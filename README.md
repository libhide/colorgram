Colorgram is tiny app I built over a weekend to fix a itch particular itch of mine.

## Story

### The Itch

Instagram for the longest time did not have a way to fill a "story" slide with a solid color. I wanted to do this on my personal Instagram to make stories more engaging because hey! FUN! 

## The App

All Colorgram does is allows the user to create a color using RGB sliders and save the resulting color has a JPG to the phone. The user can then go to Instagram and use the created image as the background for their story update!

## Repo Structure

The repo has three branches: `master`, `legacy` and `gh-pages`.

- `master` has the updated codebase written in Kotlin with all the tools the cool kids are using these days. This was again a weekend project I did to learn things.
- `legacy` is the old codebase in Java with all sorts of terrible coding practices
- `gh-pages` houses the landing page for the website because of course I'm extra af :)

## Postmortem

Soooooo, Instagram started supporting this feature natively a couple of months after I released this app. Aaaand with that, my dreams of becomnig a rockstart indie-developer died. RIP.
